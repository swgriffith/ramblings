# Cluster Management Roles
When working with Azure Kubernetes Service there can be a lot of confusion about the access needed by the individuals managing the cluster as well as the roles required by the Service Principal used by the cluster itself to execute Azure operations (ex. Creating an Azure Public IP on a Service type=LoadBalancer). The following tries to break it down and demonstrate the minimal roles required for Cluster Administration. When I say Cluster Administration I'm referring to the following:

AKS Cluster:
- Creation
- Scale
- Upgrade
- Deletion 

**Note:** Within cluster management there are some permutations if you're attaching your cluster to a Virtual Network/Subnet that is in another Subscription or Resource Group. Likewise for connecting to Log Analytics in separate Subscriptions or Resource Groups. The following breaks down all of those permutations.

## Summary of Roles
For those looking to skip the lengthy walk through below, here are the basic custom role definitions you need for Cluster management. Again, this does not include any changes you may choose to make to the Cluster Service Principal, which by default is granted Contributor rights on the MC_ Resource Group. Any of the following can be combined, however keep in mind the scope that you wish to apply. Keeping them separate gives your more granulaterity on the scope for each role.

### Retrieval of .kube/config credentials file via Azure CLI
In order to use kubectl you will need to get your cluster credentials. Azure will provide these to you using the *az aks get-credentials* command. There are two roles available to control this, as follows:

- Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role
- Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role

More info available via Azure Docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-latn-ba/azure/aks/control-kubeconfig-access)

Setup
```bash
# Grant rights to get the kubernetes cluster admin credential
az role assignment create --assignee <User> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"

# Grant rights to get the kubernetes cluster user credentials
az role assignment create --assignee <User> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role"
```

### Cluster Compute Management
This custom role provides the rights needed to create, upgrade and scale an AKS cluster for either Availability Sets (traditional model) or VM Scale Sets (new model).

Create a file called aks-compute-mgmnt-role.json with the following:
```json
{
"Name": "AKS Compute Mgr",
"IsCustom": true,
"Description": "Grants actions required to create and manage aks compute",
"Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/read",
    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/write",
    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write",
    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/read"
],
"NotActions": [

],
"AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<Insert Target Subscription or Mgmnt Group ID>"
]
}
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# Run the following, and use the json file name you used to save the above role
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-compute-mgmnt-role.json

# Assign to a user at the Cluster Resource Group scope
az role assignment create --assignee <User> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "AKS Compute Mgr"
```

### Cluster Delete
This custom role grants permissions needed to delete a cluster. 

Create a file called aks-cluster-delete-role.json with the following:
```json
{
  "Name": "AKS Cluster Delete",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Grants actions required to delete an aks cluster",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/delete"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>"
  ]
}
```
**Setup:**
```bash
# Run the follwoing and use the json file name you used to save the role above
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-cluster-delete-role.json

# Assign to a user at the Cluster level or above (i.e. Cluster, Resource Group or Subscription)
az role assignment create --assignee <User> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "AKS Cluster Delete"
```

### Cluster Network Join
This custom role provides the rights needed to attach an AKS cluster to a subnet if the cluster creator does not yet have access to that subnet.

Create a file called aks-network-mgmnt-role.json with the following:
```json
{
  "Name": "AKS Network Join",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can Join and AKS Cluster to a given vnet/subnet",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<Insert Your Subscription ID>"
  ]
}
```
**Setup:**
```bash
# Run the following, and use the json file name you used to save the above role
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-network-mgmnt-role.json

# Assign to a user at the subnet scope
az role assignment create --assignee <User> --scope "<Insert your Subnet ID from above>" --role "AKS Network Join"
```

### Cluster Join to Log Analytics
This one is a bit more complex as it requires two roles. One scoped to the resource group where log analytics resides, and a second scoped to the log analytics workspace itself. The first is required because a deployment is executed on your behalf when you try to attach to a log analytics workspace and since it's ID is dynamic you'll need to grant access at a higher level. Fortunately we've allowed such a small subset of tasks, having deployment access wont really allow anything beyond joining the workspace.

First, create a file called allow-resourcegroup-deployments.json and paste in the following:

```json
{
  "Name": "Resource Group Deployment Write",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can join an AKS cluster to a log analytics workspace",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<Insert Your Subscription ID>"
  ]
}
```

Next create a second file called aks-loganalytics-join-role.json and paste the following:
```json
{
  "Name": "AKS Log Analytics Join",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can join an AKS cluster to a log analytics workspace",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedkeys/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions/write"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<Insert Your Subscription ID>"
  ]
}
```

**Setup:**  Now you can create both role definition and assign.
```bash
az role definition create --role-definition @allow-resourcegroup-deployments.json
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-loganalytics-join-role.json

# This is scoped to the resource group containring the log analytics workspace
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/EphClusterRoleTest-Logs" --role "Resource Group Deployment Write"

# This is scoped to the log analytics workspace resource ID
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "<Insert your Log Analytics worksapce ID from above>" --role "AKS Log Analytics Join"
```
<br>

**That's it! Those roles should give you want you need to create and manage your clusters**
<br>
<br>

# Testing and proof
## Basic Cluster Creation
The First walk through will be the creation of a basic cluster where we're not attaching to any Network or Log Analytics instances outside of the MC_ resource group. This is the most straight forward as far as required roles and assigned scopes.

Create Service Principals for Cluster Admin user and Cluster internal user
```bash
# I'm creating each and writing to a file for later use, but feel free 
# to remove the redirection and grab the values yourself with copy/paste
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment>cluster-owner-sp
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment>cluster-internal-sp
```

Create the role definition for compute managment (Cluster Create, Upgrade, Scale **...but not Delete**)
1. In the cloud shell create a file named aks-compute-mgmnt-role.json, or whatever you prefer
1. Open the file and paste the following:
    ```json
    {
    "Name": "AKS Compute Mgr",
    "IsCustom": true,
    "Description": "Grants actions required to create and manage aks compute",
    "Actions": [
        "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/read",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/write",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/read"
    ],
    "NotActions": [

    ],
    "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/<Insert Target Subscription or Mgmnt Group ID>"
    ]
    }
    ```
    **Note:** You MUST provide an assignable scope, however you will assign a more specific scope when you assign this to a user, so don't worry about the broad scoping just yet.

1. From the Azure CLI run the following to create the role (Note: The @ lets you feed a file into the command parameter)
```bash
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-compute-mgmnt-role.json
```

Create target resource group
```bash
az group create -n EphClusterRoleTest -l eastus
```
Assign Compute Mgmnt role to Cluster Admin SP (Note: Use the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) here.)
```bash
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "AKS Compute Mgr"
```

Open a new CLI session (Note: Consider running this from a local install of the CLI so you can run both the cloud shell and cli separately withouth needing to keep logging in and out.)
```bash
# Login
az login --service-principal --username <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --password <Password from cluster-owner-sp file> --tenant <Insert your AAD Tenant ID>
```

Try to create a cluster with network in same RG (i.e. none specified) and no custom log analytics
```bash
az aks create -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --service-principal <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file> --client-secret <Password from cluster-internal-sp file> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3
# Cluster Creation should succeed
```
***Note:** The above creation will grant the cluster-internal service principal that you provided 'Contributor' rights on the Resource Group (MC_) created during cluster creation. That is by design, and while modification of those rights is possible it is not supported by the product at this time.*

Test getting credentials for kubectl
```bash 
az aks get-credentials -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster -a  
```
The above will be denied because user does not have either of the following roles:
- "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
- "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role"

Grant user "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
```bash
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
```

Test getting credentials again
```bash 
az aks get-credentials -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster -a 
```

Test Upgrade and Scale Operations
```bash
az aks nodepool scale -g EphClusterRoleTest --cluster-name testcluster -n nodepool1 -c 4
az aks upgrade -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --kubernetes-version 1.14.5
# Both Should succeed
```

Thats it. You now have a role definition with the minimum roles required to Create, Scale and Upgrade a basic AKS cluster. In the next sections we'll get into custom Network, Storage and Log Analytics resources, as well as the Cluster Delete role.

Before you move on, you can clean up your cluster and service principals by running the following:
```bash
az aks delete -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster -y --no-wait
az ad sp delete --id <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file>
az ad sp delete --id <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file>
```

## Cluster Creation with Subnet in Separate Sub or Resource Group
Since VM Scale Sets, or any VMs for that matter, need to join their NIC to a Subnet for network connectivity you will need network connectivity. If you run the commands above this isn't an issue because the commands above don't specify a target subnet, which means a VNet and Subnet are created in the MC_ resource group for you by the Azure Control Plane. However, if that VNet and Subnet are in a separate resource group or even a separate subscription, then you may not have rights to join a NIC to that network. The following outlines the process to validate the requirements.


Lets start by creating fresh service principals so we know there arent any roles bound yet.

```bash
# I'm creating each and writing to a file for later use, but feel free 
# to remove the redirection and grab the values yourself with copy/paste
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment>cluster-owner-sp
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment>cluster-internal-sp
```

We still have the "AKS Compute Mgr" role definition file we used above. Lets first apply that role, which we know works to our newly created cluster owner service principal, from the cluster-owner-sp file. We should also add the Cluster Admin role needed to get the Kubernetes credentials later.

```bash
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "AKS Compute Mgr"
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
```

Now lets attempt to create a cluster using a VNet and Subnet in another Resource Group, which we're not authorized to access. First we'll create the VNet and Subnet using the Azure CLI from the cloud shell.

```bash
# Create Resource Group for the vnet
az group create -n EphClusterRoleTest-Vnet -l eastus

# Create the Vnet and Subnet
az network vnet create -g EphClusterRoleTest-Vnet -n aks-test-vnet --address-prefixes10.100.0.0/16 --subnet-name aks-sub --subnet-prefixes 10.100.0.0/24

# Get the subnet ID to be used in cluster creation and save for later
az network vnet show -g EphClusterRoleTest-Vnet -n aks-test-vnet -o tsv --query subnets[0].id

##########################################
### Switch out of the cloud shell here ###
##########################################

# Login
az login --service-principal --username <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --password <Password from cluster-owner-sp file> --tenant <Insert your AAD Tenant ID>

# Attempt to create the clsuter in the new subnet
az aks create -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --service-principal <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file> --client-secret <Password from cluster-internal-sp file> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 --vnet-subnet-id '<Insert Subnet ID from above>'
```

After running the above command you should get an error that the current user doesnt have resrouce group read rights on the resource group containing the Vnet. Even if you were to address that issue you'd see an error that the user doesnt have rights to 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action' on the subnet. So we need to address both of these requirements. 

In the cloud shell create a new file called 'aks-network-mgmnt-role.json'. In this file paste the following. Note that we again give a specific subscription ID, as you need to provide a minimal assignable scope, but we will further refine when we apply.

```json
{
  "Name": "AKS Network Join",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can Join and AKS Cluster to a given vnet/subnet",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/<Insert Your Subscription ID>"
  ]
}
```

As we did previously, from the Azure CLI run the following to create the role, and then assign the role to your cluster owner service principal (i.e. the one from your cluster-owner-sp file). 

**Note:** The assignment scope below is the subnet ID where you plan to create this cluster. You could go higher (ex. VNet, Resource Group or Subscription), but lets keep it fine grained. Also notice that even though we granted resource group read, we only scoped to the subnet itself, which works fine. You dont need to give read to the whole resource group, just the subnet scope.

```bash
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-network-mgmnt-role.json

az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "<Insert your Subnet ID from above>" --role "AKS Network Join"
```

Try to deploy the cluster again. This time it should deploy successfully.

```bash
az aks create -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --service-principal <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file> --client-secret <Password from cluster-internal-sp file> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 --vnet-subnet-id '<Insert Subnet ID from above>'
```

Now try to run some scale and upgrade operations as well. Both should also work.
```bash
az aks nodepool scale -g EphClusterRoleTest --cluster-name testcluster -n nodepool1 -c 4
az aks upgrade -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --kubernetes-version 1.14.5
```


Once again, before you move on, you can clean up your cluster and service principals by running the following:
```bash
az aks delete -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster -y --no-wait
az ad sp delete --id <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file>
az ad sp delete --id <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file>
```

## Cluster Creation with the Log Analytics Workspace in a Separate Sub or Resource Group
Similar to the issue we addressed above for a VNet in a separate resource group or subscription, it's possible that you may enable monitoring and logging to an Azure Log Analytics workspace that could possibly be in a separate Resource Group or Subscription.

Lets again start by creating fresh service principals so we know there arent any roles bound yet.

```bash
# I'm creating each and writing to a file for later use, but feel free 
# to remove the redirection and grab the values yourself with copy/paste
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment>cluster-owner-sp
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment>cluster-internal-sp
```

We will again apply the Compute Manager and Cluster Admin roles we've applied before. For this excercise we'll leave off the VNet Role and just assume the VNet will be created in the MC_ resource group, per defaults.

```bash
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "AKS Compute Mgr"
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<YourTargetSubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<YourTargetAKSClusterResourceGroup>" --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
```

Now lets create a Log Analytics Workspace in another Resource Group to which the above user isn't authorized. Since Log Analytics doesnt have it's own CLI command to deploy, we'll use an Azure Resoure Manager Template. Create a new file called logAnalyticsARM.json and paste the following:

```json
{
"$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json#",
"contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
"parameters": {
    "workspaceName": {
        "type": "String",
 		"metadata": {
          "description": "Specifies the name of the workspace."
        }
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "String",
 		"defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]",
 		"metadata": {
 		  "description": "Specifies the location in which to create the workspace."
 		}
    },
    "sku": {
        "type": "String",
 		"allowedValues": [
          "Standalone",
          "PerNode",
 	      "PerGB2018"
        ],
 		"defaultValue": "PerGB2018",
         "metadata": {
        "description": "Specifies the service tier of the workspace: Standalone, PerNode, Per-GB"
 	}
      }
},
"resources": [
    {
        "type": "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces",
        "name": "[parameters('workspaceName')]",
        "apiVersion": "2015-11-01-preview",
        "location": "[parameters('location')]",
        "properties": {
            "sku": {
                "Name": "[parameters('sku')]"
            },
            "features": {
                "searchVersion": 1
            }
        }
      }
   ]
}
```
Run the following commands to create the workspace.
```bash
# Create a resource group to contain the workspace
az group create -n EphClusterRoleTest-Logs -l eastus

# Create the workspace
az group deployment create -g EphClusterRoleTest-Logs --name deploy1 --template-file logAnalyticsARM.json -o json

# When prompted provide a unique workspace name
# Also note down the resource ID from 'OutputResources.ID' for later use
# ex. /subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/EphClusterRoleTest-Logs/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/akslogs2
```

Now lets attempt to create a cluster using this new workspace

```bash
##########################################
### Switch out of the cloud shell here ###
##########################################

# Login
az login --service-principal --username <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --password <Password from cluster-owner-sp file> --tenant <Insert your AAD Tenant ID>

# Create the cluster
az aks create -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --service-principal <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file> --client-secret <Password from cluster-internal-sp file> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 --enable-addons monitoring --workspace-resource-id '<Insert your workspace ID from above>'
```

The above will initially fail with an error that you rights to perform 'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read' on the log analytics workspace. If you fix that, then you'll get an error that you need rights to 'Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write', but at a different scope (ex. /subscriptions/\[SubID\]/resourcegroups/EphClusterRoleTest-Logs/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/aks-monitoring-1570729004343). After fixing that you'll get one more noting that you need 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/write' at the log analytics scope. 

So, thats a bit messy. We will need to grant 'Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write' at the resource group level, but since we havent granted any other rights to that resource group, there really isnt anything you could deploy if you wanted. We also need two actions at the log analytics workspace level. So to keep this as secure as possible, we'll create two separate custom roles. One for log analytics deployments and then one for aks to join the workspace.

First, create a file called allow-resourcegroup-deployments.json and paste in the following:

```json
{
  "Name": "AKS Log Analytics Deployment Write",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can join an AKS cluster to a log analytics workspace",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/62afe9fc-190b-4f18-95ac-e5426017d4c8"
  ]
}
```

Next create a second file called aks-loganalytics-join-role.json and paste the following:
```json
{
  "Name": "Resource Group Deployment Write",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Can join an AKS cluster to a log analytics workspace",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write"
  ],
  "NotActions": [

  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/62afe9fc-190b-4f18-95ac-e5426017d4c8"
  ]
}
```

Now you can create both role definition and assign.
```bash
az role definition create --role-definition @allow-resourcegroup-deployments.json
az role definition create --role-definition @aks-loganalytics-join-role.json

# This is scoped to the log analytics workspace resource ID
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "<Insert your Log Analytics worksapce ID from above>" --role "AKS Log Analytics Join"

# This is scoped to the resource group containring the log analytics workspace
az role assignment create --assignee <AppID from cluster-owner-sp file> --scope "/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourcegroups/EphClusterRoleTest-Logs" --role "Resource Group Deployment Write"
```

Try to create the cluster again. This time it should succeed and within a few mintues you should see metrics flowing into log analytics.
```bash
# Create the cluster
az aks create -g EphClusterRoleTest -n testcluster --service-principal <AppID from cluster-internal-sp file> --client-secret <Password from cluster-internal-sp file> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 --enable-addons monitoring --workspace-resource-id '<Insert your workspace ID from above>'
```
