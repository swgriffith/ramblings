<h1>About me</h1>

----
<br>
After spending 13 years at Accenture, working as a developer, software engineer and eventually infrastructure and cloud engineering lead, I decided to make the jump over to Microsoft. At Microsoft I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect, which essentially means that I work with customers and partners to make sure people are getting the best experience possible on Microsoft Azure. This ranges from building hands on PoCs to education sessions, to acting directly as a solution architect embedded within customer teams.

On the personal side, I'm a father of 2 and husband of 1. I have 28years of guitar experience behind me...but still sound like I only have 7. I also love microcontrollers and electronics projects.
