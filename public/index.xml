      <description>Cluster Management Roles When working with Azure Kubernetes Service there can be a lot of confusion about the access needed by the individuals managing the cluster as well as the roles required by the Service Principal used by the cluster itself to execute Azure operations (ex. Creating an Azure Public IP on a Service type=LoadBalancer). The following tries to break it down and demonstrate the minimal roles required for Cluster Administration.</description>

      <description>gitlearnin More and more I&amp;rsquo;m working with non-dev resources that are now needing to learn Git. The following is a quick and dirty guide I threw together to share with people that could use a quick git primer.
Initial Setup https://git-scm.com/downloads
Check the current settings
git config --global --list  Note: You can also use &amp;ndash;local to see the settings for a given repository, or leave it off to see ALL settings relevant to the current repository (global and local)</description>

      <title>Setting up Google Titan Security Keys on Arch Linux</title>

      <description>Overview I recently decided to give Google Advanced Protection a shot. For those not aware, Advanced protection is Google&amp;rsquo;s first party U2F authentication system. In short, you purchase the Titan Security Bundle from Google, which includes two physical keys. One is a standard USB U2F key and the second is a bluetooth key. I decided to try this over YubiKey for no good reason, other than the fact that with Google behind it I assume it will pick up extensively.</description>

      <title>New Blog</title>

      <description>Overview Over the last few years at Microsoft I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a lot of people to help them out with Azure, and generally when I&amp;rsquo;ve solved a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve put the resolution in my public github. Unfortunately this isnt really the best place for that content..or at least the text side of it, so I decided to start moving this content over to a new personal blog.
The issue with setting up a blog, however, is that I had a lot of requirements.</description>

      <description>About me ---- After spending 13 years at Accenture, working as a developer, software engineer and eventually infrastructure and cloud engineering lead, I decided to make the jump over to Microsoft. At Microsoft I&#39;m a Cloud Solutions Architect, which essentially means that I work with customers and partners to make sure people are getting the best experience possible on Microsoft Azure. This ranges from building hands on PoCs to education sessions, to acting directly as a solution architect embedded within customer teams.</description>
