      <description>Overview Over the last few years at Microsoft I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a lot of people to help them out with Azure, and generally when I&amp;rsquo;ve solved a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve put the resolution in my public github. Unfortunately this isnt really the best place for that content..or at least the text side of it, so I decided to start moving this content over to a new personal blog.
The issue with setting up a blog, however, is that I had a lot of requirements.</description>
